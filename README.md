# meta-verse-project :meta
meta verse project is a project i created in reference to the new 
changes made by mark zuckerberg, so i decided to make a website to help people 
get access to the meta-verse 

### what to do in the meta web
- join the meteverse
- purchase your 3d oculus glasses 
- become a member 

### my biggest challenge 
- validating the signup form 
```
if(!email.value.includes("@")||!email.value.includes(".")){
       emailconfirm.innerHTML="please input a valid email!!"

   } 
   else{
       emailconfirm.innerHTML=" "
       passwordconfirm.innerHTML=" "
       linked.href="index.html"
   }
```
- making it responsive 
due to its complexity i had to remove some images for the mobile 
view so as to make it responsive to all devices 

### biggest takeaway 
- learning ow to validate a form
